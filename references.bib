	abstract = {We observed 17 graduate and advanced-undergraduate piano majors practicing a difficult, three-measure keyboard passage from a Shostakovich concerto. Participants' instructions were to practice until they were confident they could play the passage accurately at a prescribed tempo in a retention test session the following day. We analyzed the practice behaviors of each pianist in terms of numeric and nonnumeric descriptors and ranked the pianists according to the overall performance quality of their retention tests. Results indicated no significant relationship between the rankings of pianists' retention test performances and any of the following variables: practice time, number of total practice trials, and number of complete practice trials. There were significant relationships between retention test rankings and the percentage of all performance trials that were performed correctly, r = -.51, the percentage of complete performance trials that were performed correctly, r = -.71, and the number of trials performed incorrectly during practice, r= .48. The results showed that the strategies employed during practice were more determinative of performance quality at retention than was how much or how long the pianists practiced, a finding consistent with the results of related research.},

	title = {Does immediate feedback while doing homework improve learning?},
	abstract = {Much of the literature surrounding the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems has focused on the type of feedback students receive. Current research suggests that the timing of feedback also plays a role in improved learning. Some researchers have shown that delaying feedback might lead to a "desirable difficulty", where students' performance while practicing is lower, but they in fact learn more. Others using Cognitive Tutors have suggested delaying feedback is bad, but those students were using a system that gave detailed assistance. Many web-based homework systems give only correctness feedback (e.g. web-assign). Should such systems give immediate feedback or might it be better for that feedback to be delayed? It is hypothesized that immediate feedback will lead to better learning than delayed feedback. In a randomized controlled crossover-"within-subjects" design, 61 seventh grade math students participated. In one condition students received correctness feedback immediately, while doing their homework, while in the other condition, the exact same feedback was delayed, to when they checked their homework the next day in class. The results show that when given feedback immediately students learned more than when receiving the same feedback delayed.

Along with the Web Audio API, it can be used for both offline and real-time audio feature extraction on web browsers. Essentia.js is modular, lightweight, and easy-to-use, deploy, maintain, and integrate into the existing plethora of JS libraries and web technologies. It is powered by a WebAssembly back end cross-compiled from the Essentia C++ library, which facilitates a JS interface to a wide range of low-level and high-level audio features, including signal processing MIR algorithms as well as pre-trained TensorFlow.js machine learning models. It also provides a higher-level JS API and add-on MIR utility modules along with extensive documentation, usage examples, and tutorials. We benchmark the proposed library on two popular web browsers and the Node.js engine, and four devices, including mobile Android and iOS, comparing it to the native performance of Essentia and the Meyda JS library.},

The usual way to detect onsets is to look for "transient" regions in the signal, a notion that leads to many definitions: a sudden burst of energy, a change in the short-time spectrum of the signal or in the statistical properties, etc. The goal of this paper is to review, categorize, and compare some of the most commonly used techniques for onset detection, and to present possible enhancements. We discuss methods based on the use of explicitly predefined signal features: the signal's amplitude envelope, spectral magnitudes and phases, time-frequency representations; and methods based on probabilistic signal models: model-based change point detection, surprise signals, etc. Using a choice of test cases, we provide some guidelines for choosing the appropriate method for a given application.},

Curtis Roads's step-by-step presentation orients musicians, engineers, scientists, and anyone else new to computer and electronic music. The new edition continues to be the definitive tutorial on all aspects of computer music, including digital audio, signal processing, musical input devices, performance software, editing systems, algorithmic composition, MIDI, and psychoacoustics, but the second edition also reflects the enormous growth of the field since the book's original publication in 1996. New chapters cover up-to-date topics like virtual analog, pulsar synthesis, concatenative synthesis, spectrum analysis by atomic decomposition, Open Sound Control, spectrum editors, and instrument and patch editors. Exhaustively referenced and cross-referenced, the second edition adds hundreds of new figures and references to the original charts, diagrams, screen images, and photographs in order to explain basic concepts and terms. Features New chapters: virtual analog, pulsar synthesis, concatenative synthesis, spectrum analysis by atomic decomposition, Open Sound Control, spectrum editors, instrument and patch editors, and an appendix on machine learning Two thousand references support the book's descriptions and point readers to further study Mathematical notation and program code examples used only when necessary Twenty-five years of classroom, seminar, and workshop use inform the pace and level of the material},

	abstract = {This study investigates common trends and individual differences in children's practice according to six dimensions of self-regulation. Seven children, aged between 7 and 9 years at the beginning of the study, regularly videotaped their practice over a 3-year period. Behavioural coding addressed the content of practice, the nature of errors and off-task behaviours, and the interaction of family members. Low levels of self-regulatory behaviour, as evidenced in the children's ability to monitor and control their own learning, were found during practice. Learning strategies were confined almost exclusively to playing through pieces once or twice. Most errors were either ignored or corrected by repeating one or two notes. Results show that self-regulatory processes vary widely between students, even from the very early stages of musical development, and help to explain why some learners develop their performance skills quickly while others struggle. Implications for music education and future research are discussed.},

Special operations of common interest for data preparation include (a) data standardization, (b) trend removal, and (c) digital filtering. Fourier series and Fourier transforms of data differ in their theoretical properties but not in their digital computational details. One of the main reasons for the importance of fast Fourier transforms is that they can be used to provide estimates of desired spectral density and correlation functions. There are two ways to compute autocorrelation estimates. The first is the direct method, involving the computation of average products among the sample data values. The second way is the indirect approach of first computing an autospectral density estimate using fast Fourier transform (FFT) procedures and then computing the inverse transform of the autospectrum. The chapter lists iterative algebraic procedures to solve multiple-input/single-output problems.
